# Next.js Learning Project

Welcome to my Next.js learning repository! ðŸš€

## About This Project
I am currently diving into **Next.js**, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and easy routing for modern web applications. This project will be my practice ground as I explore the key features, best practices, and powerful tools that Next.js offers.

## Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of Next.js
- Experiment with server-side rendering and static generation
- Explore dynamic routing and API routes
- Learn to optimize performance and manage SEO effectively
- Build a small project to apply what I've learned

## Topics Covered
1. **Pages and Routing** â€“ Understanding the Next.js file-based routing system
2. **Static Generation and Server-side Rendering** â€“ Learning when and how to pre-render pages
3. **API Routes** â€“ Creating custom backend API routes within Next.js
4. **CSS and Styling** â€“ Applying styles in Next.js using CSS modules, Sass, and Tailwind CSS
5. **Data Fetching** â€“ Fetching data with `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths`
6. **Deployment** â€“ Setting up deployments for Next.js applications
